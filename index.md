## Section B12, Lindsey Kostas

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting thing we covered in this domain this quarter was how we can transform chip architecture into data suitable for a graph machine learning model. While a lot of the other topics discussed were very cool, this was the most interesting to me as encoding various and different aspects of nodes and graphs has no straightforward method, and a lot of the strategies seem to work and allow graph structures to propagate through GNNs.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
