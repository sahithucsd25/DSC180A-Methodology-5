## Section B12, Lindsey Kostas

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting thing we covered in this domain this quarter was how we can transform chip architecture into data suitable for a graph machine learning model. While a lot of the other topics discussed were very cool, this was the most interesting to me as encoding various and different aspects of nodes and graphs has no straightforward method, and a lot of the strategies seem to work and allow graph structures to propagate through GNNs.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
As such, I would like to investigate other methods for encoding information about nodes. This may be a lot more mathematical than a traditional ML problem, but it would be pretty interesting to delve into different aspects of graphs and how the relevant information can be encoded with minimal loss.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Our Quarter 1 Project is "simply" re-implementing the "DE-HNN" paper. As such, there are no changes I would make.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in using some other ML techniques to predict features and add those to the encoding.
